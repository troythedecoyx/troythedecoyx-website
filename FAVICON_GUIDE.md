# Favicon Setup Guide

Your website is configured to use favicons, but you need to create the actual image files. Here's how:

## Required Favicon Files

You need to create these files and place them in your website's root directory:

1. **favicon.ico** - 16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels (multi-size ICO file)
2. **favicon-16x16.png** - 16x16 pixels
3. **favicon-32x32.png** - 32x32 pixels
4. **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180x180 pixels (for iOS devices)
5. **android-chrome-192x192.png** - 192x192 pixels (for Android)
6. **android-chrome-512x512.png** - 512x512 pixels (for Android)

## How to Create Favicons

### Option 1: Online Favicon Generators (Easiest)
1. Go to one of these sites:
   - https://favicon.io/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload your logo/image or create a simple design
3. Download the generated favicon package
4. Extract and upload all files to your website root

### Option 2: Create from Your Logo
1. Start with a square image (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Use an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva) to resize:
   - 16x16, 32x32, 180x180, 192x192, 512x512
3. Save as PNG files with the names listed above
4. Convert one to .ico format for favicon.ico

### Option 3: Simple Text-Based Favicon
If you want something quick:
- Use "T" or "TT" as your favicon
- Use your brand colors
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Quick Design Tips

- **Keep it simple** - Favicons are tiny, so complex designs won't work
- **Use high contrast** - Make sure it's visible on light and dark backgrounds
- **Square format** - All favicons should be square
- **Brand colors** - Use your purple/pink gradient colors (#6366f1, #8b5cf6, #ec4899)

## After Creating Favicons

1. Upload all favicon files to your website's root directory (same folder as index.html)
2. Test by visiting your website and checking the browser tab
3. Clear your browser cache if the old favicon still shows

## Open Graph Image

You also need to create **og-image.jpg** (1200x630 pixels) for social media sharing:
- This appears when someone shares your site on Facebook, Twitter, etc.
- Should include your logo/branding
- Keep text minimal and readable

**Note:** The website will work without favicons, but they make it look more professional!
